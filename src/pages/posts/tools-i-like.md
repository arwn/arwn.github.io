# Some Tools I Like

- [jujutsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj) - vcs but good
- [astro](https://astro.build/) - (this site was built in astro)
- [quickserv](https://github.com/jstrieb/quickserv) - dependency-free, statically-linked, single-file web server

## Command Line
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)  - a git ui for people like me
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - it's basically `grep` but faster
- [grex](https://github.com/pemistahl/grex) - an easier way to generate regular expressions
- [gron](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron) - make JSON Greppable!
- [jless](https://jless.io/) - JSON explorer

## fonts
- [PixelCode](https://github.com/qwerasd205/PixelCode) - pixelated monospace font
- [Departure Mono](https://departuremono.com/) - another pixelated monospace font
- [Berkely Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/) - nice monospace font :)

Maybe I'll categorize these later..
